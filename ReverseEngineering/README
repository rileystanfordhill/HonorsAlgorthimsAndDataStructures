So first, I began to deobfuscate the code. I changed a lot of the variables names so that it would be easier to follow. 

Then, I ran some of the functions on an online javascript compiler and discovered that the program only works if the ^86 is added 
to the end of the string to add to the "qzxhgymazu" variable. 

I replaced the function call with ^86, and then deleted (commented out) the function used to return that character from a character 
array. So next, I copied the function used to parse to an integer, the function to return the big string, the function to decode the 
string, and the call to the function into an online javascript compiler. I also added a print statement to print the variable I renamed as 
"result." The printed output was the code (the other file in this folder called Decoded). 

Some issues I ran into: 
  - the escape character in the .match function had to be changed, so that took some googling to determine what it needed to be changed to. 
  - determining that the ^ is the only character that does not crash the program
  - figuring out how to use an online javascript compiler (lol)
